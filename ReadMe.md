# A basic webserver
- Below are the steps to run the server.
- Run ```build.sh``` . this will automatically do everythingfor you.
- Go into the build directory and run the executable with the port number
- Open your web browser and in URL, enter the local IP to get a response from the server.
- eg ```http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER/``` .
- Note: the ```PORT_NUMBER``` must match the port number of the server.
- Also... Server extracts your information too. Pretty cool what a server could do ,huh?
- Note: This needs a unix/unix-like environment. Either run this on WSL, a linux distro or a mac.
