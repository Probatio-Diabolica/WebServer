# A basic webserver
- Below are the steps to run ```build.sh``` . this will automatically do everythingfor you.
- Go into the build directory and run the executable with the port number
- Open your web browser and in URL, enter the local IP to get a response from the server.
- eg ```http://localhost:PORT_NUMBER/``` .
- Note: the port Number must match the portnumber of server.
- Also... Server extracts your information too. pretty cool, what a server could do ,huh?
- Note: This needs a unix/unix-like environment. Either run this on WSL, a linux distro or a mac.
